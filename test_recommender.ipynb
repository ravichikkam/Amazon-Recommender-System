Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century\\'s most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There\\'s almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn\\'t hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.\\\\n\"', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0826414346\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dr. Seuss: American Icon\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: unknown\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A3UH4UZ4RSVO82\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: John Granger\\\\n'\", \"b'review/helpfulness: 10/11\\\\n'\", \"b'review/score: 5.0\\\\n'\", \"b'review/time: 1078790400\\\\n'\", \"b'review/summary: Essential for every personal and Public Library\\\\n'\", 'b\\'review/text: If people become the books they read and if \"the child is father to the man,\" then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel\\\\\\'s brilliant \\\\\\'American Icon\\\\\\' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel\\\\\\'s discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, \"the other sides of Dr. Seuss\" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel\\\\\\'s poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a \"must buy\" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel\\\\\\'s other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children\\\\\\'s literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0826414346\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dr. Seuss: American Icon\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: unknown\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A2MVUWT453QH61\\\\n'\", 'b\\'review/profileName: Roy E.

A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today\\'s bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel\\'s birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss\\'s career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel\\'s childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss\\'s writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You\\'ll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss\\'s breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person\\'s a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss\\'s bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan\\'s enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel\\'s work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss\\'s early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss\\'s life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author\\'s lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling\\'s Harry Potter Novels: A Reader\\'s Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E.

It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children\\\\\\'s Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to \"cash in\" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss\\\\\\' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today\\\\\\'s standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss\\\\\\'s many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0826414346\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dr. Seuss: American Icon\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: unknown\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A2F6NONFUDB6UK\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: Malvin\\\\n'\", \"b'review/helpfulness: 2/2\\\\n'\", \"b'review/score: 4.0\\\\n'\", \"b'review/time: 1127174400\\\\n'\", 'b\"review/summary: One of America\\'s greatest creative talents\\\\n\"', 'b\\'review/text: \"Dr. Seuss: American Icon\" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss\\\\\\' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss\\\\\\' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss\\\\\\' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss\\\\\\' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children\\\\\\'s work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term \"energetic cartoon surrealism\" appropriately describes Seuss\\\\\\' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss\\\\\\' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children\\\\\\'s books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the \"Disneyification\" or simplification of Seuss\\\\\\' stories for marketable purposes \"threatens to make \\\\\\'Seuss\\\\\\' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism\". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss\\\\\\' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America\\\\\\'s greatest creative talents.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0826414346\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dr. Seuss: American Icon\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: unknown\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A14OJS0VWMOSWO\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: Midwest Book Review\\\\n'\", \"b'review/helpfulness: 3/4\\\\n'\", \"b'review/score: 5.0\\\\n'\", \"b'review/time: 1100131200\\\\n'\", 'b\"review/summary: A memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss\\' many achievements\\\\n\"', 'b\"review/text: Theodor Seuss Giesel was best known as \\'Dr. Seuss\\', one of the most influential and enduringly popular children\\'s authors of the 20th century.

However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. \"Dr. Seuss: American Icon\" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes.

If the word \\'study\\' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss\\'s visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable \\'Grinch\\' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the \\'Cat in the Hat\\' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don\\'t believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I\\'m sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss\\'s gender politics.

In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book?

I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine\\\\\\'s husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other\\\\\\'s throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she\\\\\\'ll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he\\\\\\'s dying too, and she\\\\\\'s pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn\\\\\\'t have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the \"wicked saints\" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon\\\\\\'s book (you can click on \"other reviews\" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been.

The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled \"The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,\" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase \"kingdom of God\" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the \"rock\" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus\\\\\\' Messiahship. Ferguson\\\\\\'s analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to \"the gates of Hades will not prevail\" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, \"The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,\" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, \"people of God,\" \"body of Christ,\" and \"community of the Spirit.\" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, \"The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership.\" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God\\\\\\'s saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson\\\\\\'s soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: \"Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God\" (pg. 170); \"Baptism is a `calling on the name\\\\\\' of the Lord\" (pg. 180); and, \"Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness\" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do\" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson\\\\\\'s words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, \"The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly\" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. \"The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry\" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women\\\\\\'s roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women\\\\\\'s roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, \"The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life.\" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson\\\\\\'s section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson\\\\\\'s conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0802841899\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: 25.97\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A36TPZSH8LBT1\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: haskell\\\\n'\", \"b'review/helpfulness: 2/3\\\\n'\", \"b'review/score: 5.0\\\\n'\", \"b'review/time: 1311465600\\\\n'\", \"b'review/summary: Early Christian development of the Church\\\\n'\", 'b\"review/text: Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words.

Now, if you\\\\\\'re a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0918973031\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dramatica for Screenwriters\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: 17.95\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A2JCSLVBZ1BZ46\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: David I.

Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I\\\\\\'ve made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (\"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story\") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I\\\\\\'ve long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I\\\\\\'m no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I\\\\\\'ve got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I\\\\\\'d had high hopes for \"Dramatica For Screenwriters\", figuring it would serve as a practical layman\\\\\\'s guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there\\\\\\'s that word again), despite claims in the author\\\\\\'s introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in \"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story\", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won\\\\\\'t understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don\\\\\\'t need it.\\\\n\\'', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0918973031\\\\n'\", \"b'product/title: Dramatica for Screenwriters\\\\n'\", \"b'product/price: 17.95\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A1PYZR7NRX62CN\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: Tim Rohde\\\\n'\", \"b'review/helpfulness: 1/1\\\\n'\", \"b'review/score: 5.0\\\\n'\", \"b'review/time: 1344211200\\\\n'\", \"b'review/summary: Practical Guide to a Complicated Process\\\\n'\", 'b\"review/text: Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn.

However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk\\'s &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller\\'s &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn\\'t care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don\\'t know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it\\'s nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn\\'t have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk\\'s book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you\\'re interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright\\'s book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk\\'s book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you.

Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn\\'t right for me at all! Thank you Mrs. Wright, you saved me $100,000.00! I definitly recommend that EVERYONE read this chapter first!

She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis\\'s great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce\\'s Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media.\\\\n\"', \"b'\\\\n'\", \"b'product/productId: 0809080699\\\\n'\", 'b\"product/title: The Repeal of Reticence: A History of America\\'s Cultural and Legal Struggles over Free Speech, Obscenity, Sexual Liberation, and Modern Art\\\\n\"', \"b'product/price: unknown\\\\n'\", \"b'review/userId: A29LG535LJRITI\\\\n'\", \"b'review/profileName: Edward J.

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper\\\\\\'s book \"Aerobics\" (a term he coined), then to \"Aerobics Program for total Well Being...\", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book \"Start Strong, Finish Strong\" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I\\\\\\'ve got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I\\\\\\'m in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.\\\\n\\'']\n"

Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.\\n\"]"
